# DU

DU is a project built around scalability and modularity. Throughout the process I've had to refine my experience with certain subjects (Beahviour Trees, Body & Soul delegation for unit logic, Ability Systems, and more). The goal is to replicate AAA development methodoligies and systems design for creation of modular and extensible code. 

## Getting Started

The project is built on Unity 2023.3.11F1, but should work on any version of Unity 2023.3 LTS. 

## Tools Used

* [Node Canvas](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/nodecanvas-14914) - Data driven behaviour tree in-editor. 
* [SPAM](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/spam-spell-projectile-ability-magic-framework-204027) - Ability System aiming to mimic the functionality of Unreal's GAS (Gameplay Ability System).
* [Agent Navigation](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/agents-navigation-239233) - Swarming behaviours.

## Acknowledgments

* Have to give a big thanks to my mentor Camille for insight into how AAA handles these topics. 

* Game inspiration is [TeamfightTactics](https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) (Riot) meets [LegionTD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/469600/Legion_TD_2__Multiplayer_Tower_Defense/) (Warcraft 3)
