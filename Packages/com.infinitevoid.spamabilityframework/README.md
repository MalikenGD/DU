Thank you for purchasing SPAM Framework.

The complete documentation can be found either in the root of the project, or online at https://spam.infinitevoid.games. 

This asset follows the improved UPM-package structure, which means that the sample is not downloaded automatically upon installation.

To install the sample project, navigate to "SPAM Ability Framework" in the Package Manager inside Unity and click "Import" next to "Example Game - Top Down Royale" under samples. This will import the same game to a "Samples" folder in your project.
